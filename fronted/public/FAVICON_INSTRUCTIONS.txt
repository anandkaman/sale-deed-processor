HOW TO CHANGE THE WINDOWS TASKBAR & BROWSER TAB ICON
=====================================================

The icon you see in the Windows taskbar and browser tab is called a "favicon".

CURRENT SETUP:
--------------
✓ You already have logo.png in this folder
✓ The HTML is configured to use it as favicon

STEPS TO SEE THE ICON:
----------------------

1. CREATE A FAVICON.ICO FILE (Recommended for Windows)

   Option A - Use an online converter (EASIEST):
   - Go to: https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
   - Upload your logo.png file
   - Download the generated files
   - You'll get: favicon.ico, favicon-16x16.png, favicon-32x32.png
   - Copy ALL these files to: d:\saledeed_2025\fronted\public\

   Option B - Use a tool:
   - Use GIMP, Photoshop, or online tool to convert logo.png to favicon.ico
   - Save as: d:\saledeed_2025\fronted\public\favicon.ico

2. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE
   - Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
   - Clear cached images and files
   - Or use Incognito/Private mode to test

3. RESTART THE REACT APP
   - Stop the server (Ctrl + C)
   - Run: npm start
   - The new icon should appear in browser tab

4. FOR WINDOWS TASKBAR ICON
   - The browser's favicon will be used when you pin the app
   - Close all browser windows of the app
   - Clear browser cache
   - Restart browser and open the app
   - Pin to taskbar - it should now show your AI DOC PROCESS icon

RECOMMENDED FILES IN public/ FOLDER:
------------------------------------
favicon.ico           (For Windows, IE, old browsers)
favicon-16x16.png     (Small icon)
favicon-32x32.png     (Medium icon)
logo.png              (Your main logo - already exists ✓)
apple-touch-icon.png  (For iOS/Mac - optional)

WHY YOU MIGHT NOT SEE CHANGES:
------------------------------
- Browser cache (clear it!)
- Old favicon is cached by Windows
- Need to restart browser completely
- Development server needs restart

QUICK TEST:
-----------
After adding favicon.ico, visit:
http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico

If you see your icon, it's working! Just clear cache to see it in the tab.
